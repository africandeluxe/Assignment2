In this assignment I created a Text Based JavaScript Game

My knowledge of vanilla JS concepts such as variables, arrays, loops, conditional logic and the nesting of these will be tested. 
The concept of the game was entirely up to me, but was recommend something similar to a game like simplified Wordle, Mastermind or Hangman. Games like sten, sax, påse are also fine, but would require some kind of counter to break the while loop ie one iteration of a simple game like that would not meet the criteria for godkänt.

User input can be assumed to NOT include more than one occurrence of a character - if using numbers you can anticipate a sequence like 1234, if using letters a sequence of abcd. A sequence such as 1233 or 'hello' will not be inputted. More than one occurrence of a character will make comparison to an array a level higher in complexity than what is needed.

The game only needs to run via prompts and alerts - an external JS file loaded in the head section of an HTML page is all that is required. I could use the console. No HTML or CSS is required,  The game itself needs to rely on prompts for user input. 
An understating of fundamental vanilla JS concepts is what I would be graded on, how it looks is irrelevant and will not be assessed
